            Making progress with your training takes a lot of time. You have to lay out a plan that works for you and adapts to your life, regularly check in on what the data from each week shows you to make adjustments, and have backup plans for when life throws a wrench at your training. If you value your training and making progress on your goals but don’t have the time to develop and implement your own plan, this coaching option is perfect for you.        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            SBF General Coaching is coaching and programming for anyone who wants to learn the basics of lifting, or who already understands the basics of strength training and wants to make progress on their strength/lifting goals, but without worrying about the intricacies of nutrition, weight change, etc. Programming is designed using the latest research in exercise science and experiential data. Together we will build you a lifting program that is optimal within the context of your life, progresses at your own pace, and adapts to your needs and recovery. We’ll also have regular check-ins to see how everything is going and make changes as necessary.        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Coaching is about much more than just changing spreadsheets every couple of weeks. I'm here to build a genuine relationship with you and provide you with support, guidance, mentoring, and education. I truly believe that we can both learn so much from one another, and in doing so, we'll work together to set reasonable goals and expectations, and work toward them in a healthy, safe, and sustainable way.        </p>

          The recommended full price is $75 per month, but the minimum price is only $55 per month, charged automatically each month until we feel you are ready to continue your own programming and training independently.
          You can choose to pay the full $75 per month, or more – as much as you feel the coaching services are worth. The extra money will go directly to paying for coaching services for those who cannot afford to pay full price.
          I have lower sliding-scale prices available upon request. I am also willing to negotiate barter-and-trading of services. No matter what, I do not turn anyone away due to lack of funds, so if you are concerned please send me an email and we'll figure something out for you.

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">*Movement screening is required for all clients regardless of stated skill level in lifting before starting any program.</span> This is essential to ensure your safety before adding on additional load, which could potentially reinforce inefficient or unsafe movement patterns under heavy load. Your program will be designed to address severe technique issues, under light or no load, that might put your safety at risk before loading an exercise with more weight.

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">**Disclaimer:</span> This is coaching, programming, support, and education for amateur/recreational lifters, or lifters in a specific strength sport (e.g. bodybuilding/physique sports, powerlifting, etc.) If you are looking for strength & conditioning coaching for another sport that involves or is related to resistance training (e.g. American football, wrestling, basketball, etc.), I would strongly recommend hiring a sports-specific coach/trainer, or a certified Strength & Conditioning Coach. If you are looking for a targeted nutrition plan for weight loss/management or for support of non-lifting athletic endeavors, I would strongly recommend hiring a registered dietitian.
