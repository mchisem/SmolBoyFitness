                  <p class="card-text" style="text-align: left !important;">
                    Hey there! My name is nat, and I’m the coach behind SBF. I made my debut in fitness at 13 when I went to my first tae kwon do class - after having spent my entire childhood hating every sport I tried up to then – and the rest is history. I spent seven years working to be one of the top students in my studio to the rank of 3rd degree black belt, getting my instructor certification along the way and teaching for over 5 years. This is where my love of teaching movement was born.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I loved everything about teaching martial arts – not only because I enjoyed the process and it made me a better student, but because I loved watching my students break plateaus and get better over time. I was fascinated by how each student responded uniquely to different training techniques and became amazing athletes through their own journey, and I loved getting to be the mentor that helped them get there. I have carried all of those experiences over into now being a strength and physique coach.
                    Eventually I swapped martial arts for lifting weights, and I remember feeling helpless having to maneuver the gym space almost completely by myself. I loved lifting, but the gym environment made me feel self-conscious and was full of a toxic culture that had me giving myself a pep talk every time I walked in. I felt so small, surrounded by guys twice my size. On top of that, it took me years to figure out what I was doing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I got my personal training certification and started SBF with the intent of being for other people what I wish I had my first several years of training. I wish I had had guidance and support – a mentor that would help me with my programming, tweak my technique, know the research, and throw around ideas when I hit a plateau. More than that, I wish I had someone that knew what it was like to be a very visibly queer and trans in that space. Someone who knew what it was like to be stared at because you’re the pipsqueak at the gym, or because you were unapologetically androgynous, but just wanted to focus on the iron and get swole like everyone else.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I call myself “Smol Boy” because that’s how all my college pals referred to me: I was the smallest one in the group, but I had the biggest muscles. Small + Swole = Smol! Thank goodness they called me that, because I used to feel so insecure about being the smallest and queerest bro in the gym. Now, it’s a symbol of pride.
