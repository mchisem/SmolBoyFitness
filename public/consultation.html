          There are several facets of strength training that go into reaching your full potential, especially if you’re serious about your progress and are thinking about competing, but sometimes it’s hard to go it alone. Not everybody needs a full-time coach giving them guidance and support, but it’s still better to get a custom program, or to sit down with a coach and discuss the ins and outs of the questions you have.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          If you have any questions about training, programming, technique, conditioning, recovery, nutrition, behavior change, goal-setting, or anything else, hit me up. If you need help with your own goals or programming, want me to help you set up a 6-12 week program for you, or anything else, reach out for a one-off consultation with me.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          This is a one-hour video consultation with me to discuss whatever you’re interested in related to lifting. You can always pay for more consultations in the future if you need or want to as well. Any training program is designed using the latest research in exercise science and experiential data, as well as any advice or guidance I’m able to give. Together we will help you find the answers you’re looking for or build a program that is optimal within the context of your life and progresses at your own pace.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Coaching is about much more than just changing spreadsheets every couple of weeks. I'm here to build a genuine relationship with you and provide you with support, guidance, mentoring, and education. I truly believe that we can both learn so much from one another, and in doing so, we'll work together to set reasonable goals and expectations, and work toward them in a healthy, safe, and sustainable way.
        </p>

          The recommended full price is $95 per month, but the minimum price is only $75 per month, charged automatically each month until we feel you are ready to continue your own programming and training independently.
          You can choose to pay the full $95 per month, or more – as much as you feel the coaching services are worth. The extra money will go directly to paying for coaching services for those who cannot afford to pay full price.
          I have lower sliding-scale prices available upon request. I am also willing to negotiate barter-and-trading of services. No matter what, I do not turn anyone away due to lack of funds, so if you are concerned please send me an email and we'll figure something out for you.

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">*Movement screening is required for all clients regardless of stated skill level in lifting before starting any program.</span> This is essential to ensure your safety before adding on additional load, which could potentially reinforce inefficient or unsafe movement patterns under heavy load. Your program will be designed to address severe technique issues, under light or no load, that might put your safety at risk before loading an exercise with more weight.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">**Disclaimer:</span> This is coaching, programming, support, and education for amateur/recreational lifters, or lifters in a specific strength sport (e.g. bodybuilding/physique sports, powerlifting, etc.) If you are looking for strength & conditioning coaching for another sport that involves or is related to resistance training (e.g. American football, wrestling, basketball, etc.), I would strongly recommend hiring a sports-specific coach/trainer, or a certified Strength & Conditioning Coach. If you are looking for a targeted nutrition plan for weight loss/management or for support of non-lifting athletic endeavors, I would strongly recommend hiring a registered dietitian.
